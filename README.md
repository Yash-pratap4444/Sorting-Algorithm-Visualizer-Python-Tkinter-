# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer-Python-Tkinter-
This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using Python’s Tkinter library. It visually demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work step-by-step using animated colored bars.
Each bar represents a number, and as the algorithm sorts, the bars are rearranged in increasing order — giving you a real-time visualization of the sorting process.
Features:
-> Animated visualization of multiple sorting algorithms

-> Adjustable speed control slider

-> Randomized bar generation (Shuffle button)

-> Button disabling during sorting (to avoid conflicts)

->Clean Tkinter GUI with interactive buttons

-> Aesthetic purple-colored bars

GUI Preview:
The visualizer displays multiple vertical purple bars representing random integers.
When a sorting algorithm is selected, the bars move step-by-step to form a sorted sequence.
