Code Highlights:

->Uses Tkinter Canvas to draw bars dynamically.

->Implements each sorting algorithm as a Python generator (yield based), allowing smooth animation frame-by-frame.

->The animate() function continuously calls next(worker) using after() for timed animation.

->Clean UI with disabled buttons during execution to prevent interruptions.
